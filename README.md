# homepage

Responsive homepage created that acts as a portfolio to display my favourite projects I've created to date and introduces myself and my passion for Web Development.

The project put into practice the previous lessons which were around web accessibility and responsive design. 

The project was achieved by implementing media queries for those viewing on a mobile, tablet or a desktop.
